\chapter{Theory}
\large{\textbf{The Unilateral Laplace Transform :}}\par

The unilateral Laplace transform, is of considerable value in analyzing causal systems and, particularly, systems specified by linear constant-coefficient differential equations with nonzero initial conditions (i.e., systems that are not initially at rest). \\
Some of the Unilateral Laplace Transform pairs are given below:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Table.png}
\end{center}

So, given a system with an input $x(t)$ and output $y(t)$, and if it is known that the system is \textbf{Linear and Time-Invariant}, then we can write the relation of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ in the laplace domain as follows, and let the system response is $h(t)$,

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{LTI.png}
\end{center}
We can also compute the initial state response, final state response and Natural response and Forced response, of we know the Transfer function of a system and the initial conditions of the system.

\section{Solving the Problem 1:}
The Laplace Transform of the function, $f(t) = cos(1.5t)e^{-0.5t}u_0(t)$is to be found and then we have to solve for the system for which $f(t)$ is input and the system is described as, \\
\begin{equation*}
\ddot{x}+2.25{x}= f(t)
\end{equation*}
With initial conditions as, $x(0) = 0$ and $\dot{x}(0)= 0$, for t going from zero to 50 seconds.\\
We can solve this by using system.impulse, as it computes the impulse response of a given transfer function. Thus we input the output's transfer function in-order to get its impulse response, which is the solution required in t-domain.\\
This can be implemented as follows:\\

\begin{verbatim}
################1 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
a=0.5	## a is the decay
freq=1.5
s=trans(a,freq)
H_1=sp.lti(s[0],s[1])
t_1,x_1=sp.impulse(H_1,None,t)
\end{verbatim}

Where $trans()$, is a defined function, by me, as follows:\\
\begin{verbatim}
def trans(a,freq):
	num=array([1,a])
	den=polymul(num,num)
	den=polyadd(den,array([freq**2]))
	
	charac=array([1,0,2.25])
	den_final=polymul(den,charac)
	
	s=[num,den_final,den,charac]
	return s
\end{verbatim}

So, in the function $trans()$, I defined the transfer functions, which are required for all the problems.

\section{Solving the Problem 2:}
This problem is nothing but repeating the first, with a smaller decay.\\
The Laplace Transform of the function, $f(t) = cos(1.5t)e^{-0.05t}u_0(t)$is to be found and then we have to solve for the system for which $f(t)$ is input and the system is described as, \\
\begin{equation*}
\ddot{x}+2.25{x}= f(t)
\end{equation*}
With initial conditions as, $x(0) = 0$ and $\dot{x}(0)= 0$, for t going from zero to 50 seconds.\\
We can solve this by using system.impulse, as it computes the impulse response of a given transfer function. Thus we input the output's transfer function in-order to get its impulse response, which is the solution required in t-domain.\\
This can be implemented as follows:\\

\begin{verbatim}
################2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
a=0.05	## a is the decay
freq=1.5
s=trans(a,freq)
H_2=sp.lti(s[0],s[1])
t_2,x_2=sp.impulse(H_2,None,t)
\end{verbatim}

 
\section{Solving the Problem 3:}
In this problem, we solve the same system as in the problems 1 and 2, but what we do differently than the previous problems is that we vary the frequency of the inputs.\\
I implemented this by the following code:

\begin{verbatim}
freq=arange(1.4,1.6,0.05)
freq=list(freq)
a=0.05
col=["y","b","g","orange","m"]
H_3=sp.lti(array([1]),array([1,0,2.25]))
figure(3)
for i in freq:
	t_3,x_3,svec=sp.lsim(H_3,input(i,t),t)
	plot(t,x_3,label="\u03C9 = "+str(i),color=col[freq.index(i)])#
\end{verbatim}


\section{Solving the Problem 4:}
In this we, have to a coupled spring problem, whose system is defined as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\ddot{x}+(x-y)=0\\
\ddot{y}+2(y-x)=0
\end{equation*}%
where the initial condition is  $x(0) = 1,    \dot{x}(0) = y(0) = \dot{y}(0) = 0$.
The above equations translaet to:
\begin{equation*}
s^2X(s)-s+X(s)-Y(s)=0\\
s^2Y(s)+2(Y(s)-X(s))=0
\end{equation*}%

We need to solve for its time evolution, and from it obtain x(t) and y(t) for $0 ≤ t ≤ 20$\\
So, initially I'm defining the transfer functions for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, by asserting the proper boundary conditions, and then solving for the individual impulse responses by using the function $.impulse()$.\\
So, after solving the transfer functions are as follows:
\begin{equation*}
X(s)=\frac{s^3+2s}{(s^2+2)(s^2+2)-2} \\
Y(s)=\frac{2(s^3+2s)}{((s^2+2)(s^2+2)-2)(s^2+2)} 
\end{equation*}
And then solving for the impulse responses.
\begin{verbatim}
################4 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
t=linspace(0,20,20001)
num_x=array([1,0,2,0])
den_x=polyadd( polymul(array([1,0,2]),array([1,0,1])) , array([-2]))
X=sp.lti(num_x,den_x)
num_y=polymul(num_x,array([2]))
den_y=polymul(den_x,array([1,0,2]))
Y=sp.lti(num_y,den_y)
t_x,x=sp.impulse(X,None,t)
t_y,y=sp.impulse(Y,None,t)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Solving the Problem 5:}



In this problem, we have to obtain the magnitude and phase response of the Steady State Transfer function of the following two-port network:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{circuit.png}
\end{center}

So, the transfer function for the above circuit is as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \frac{\frac{1}{sC}}{R+sL+\frac{1}{sC}}
\end{equation*}%

By substituting the values of R, L, C and the solving it by the $.impulse()$ function, we get the t-domain for the above circuit.

And this is implemented in python as follows:\\
\begin{verbatim}
R=100
L=1e-6
C=1e-6

num=array([1])
den=array([L*C,R*C,1])
H_5=sp.lti(num,den)
w_5,S_5,phi_5=sp.bode(H_5) # w=r
\end{verbatim}

\section{Solving the Problem 6:}
This problem is nothing but repeating the fifth, with a defined input:\\
\begin{equation*}
v_i(t) = cos(10^3t)u(t)−cos(10^6t)u(t)
\end{equation*}%
and the transfer function is mentioned above (in problem 5).\\
Let the impulse response of the system - $H(s)$ is $h(t)$, and for finding the output in  t-domain, we need to convolute the functions $h(t)$ and $v_i(t)$\\
\begin{equation*}
v_o(t) = h(t)*v_i(t)
\end{equation*}%
Thus this can be implemented by the pre-defined function in signal toolbox, $.lsim()$
\begin{verbatim}
t=linspace(0,10e-3,20001)
u=cos((1e3)*t)-cos((1e6)*t)
t,y,svec=sp.lsim(H_5,u,t)
t,y,svec=sp.lsim(H_5,u,t)
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{Conclusion and Reasoning:}
\section{In Problem 3, when varying the Frequency:}
As the characteristic response of the system is,
\begin{equation*}
H(s)=\frac{1}{s^2+(1.5)^2}
\end{equation*}%
So, it has a natural frequency of $\omega =1.5 radsec^{-1}$, thus -the poles are on the imaginary axes, thus there is no damping in the system.\\
So, when we provide a signal of frequency $1.5 radsec^{-1}$, it is going to resonate with the system, hence the maximum amplitude at that frequency.


\section{In Problem 6, in the first $30\mu $ seconds}

As, initially the transient responses do not die, and also the natural frequency of the system is higher when compared to that of the input's frequency.\\
So, as the natural response do not die for the first few moments, thus the natural response's is going to dominate initially.\\
As time progresses, the natural response gets attenuated enough, so that the forced response dominates over the natural response.\\
The small ripples in the output are due to the attenuated natural response of the system.
